[] create a file

Questions

- `Create a file of a specified type at a specified location`
  - How do we expect this type and location to be specified? Command line arguments? Interactive input?
- `Establish a network connection and transmit data`
  - Should the connection details (destination address & port, protocol, data) be specified by the user or can it be the same every time?
- `Process command line`
  - Does this mean the command used to call the process? i.e. `curl www.google.com`
